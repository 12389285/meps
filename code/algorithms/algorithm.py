    This algorithm runs the non-deterministic algorithms

    This function takes as input arguments:
        - the filled in schedule (hard constraints are satisfied, but furthermore not an optimal schedule)
        - the number of iterations requested by the user
        - the roomlist
        - the courselist (classes)
        - the overlapping dictionary
        - boolean for Simulated Annealing or Hillclimber (boolean)


    This function works as follows:
    - Saves the current score and current schedule
    - It sets the temperature and number of swaps and makes a scoreplotlist
    - It then iterates as many times as the user requests

    - The current score of the scorefunction is calculated
    - It picks 2 random activities (by picking a day, a timelock and a roomlock)
    - It makes a copy of the current schedule to store the swap schedule and makes both chosen roomlocks None
    - It checks if swapping the 2 activities satisfies the hard constraints

    - If the user instructed simulated annealing:
    - If 1000 times simulated function is called, the temperature drops
    - The simulated annealing function is called to determine if the schedule is swapped
    - The new score is calculated, new_score and schedule are saved if new score is lower than the best old score
    -

    - If the user instructed the hillclimber:
    - The hillclimber function determines if the schedule is swapped and the schedule is saved in schedule_save
