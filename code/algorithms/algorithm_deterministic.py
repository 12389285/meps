    - the empty schedule
    - number of iterations
    - the roomlist,
    - the overlapping dictionary
    - boolean for Simulated Annealing or Hillclimber (boolean)

    This function works as follows:
    - First a random schedule is made by calling the function make_random_schedule.
    - The score of the random schedule is saved, a copy of the schedule is made and the temperature is set.

    - The algorithm is run as many times as instructed by the user.
    - Every loop the temperature drops with a certain amount (only needed in the simulated annealing).
    - The algorithm iterates through every roomlock in the schedule (first),
    - Then the function swap_with_every is called, which swaps this roomlock with every roomlock
      in the schedule. This swap function returns a score_list, an array_day,
      an array_timelock and an array_roomlock such that in a later stadium the activity of the swap can be found.

    - If the user instructed simulated annealing: the simulated annealing function determines the index of swap.
    - The swap function swaps with the chosen swap index.
    - If the swap has a better score then the saved score (at simulated annealing not always the case),
      this score and this schedule are saved

    - When the user instructed hillclimber: the hillclimber function determines the index of swap.
    - The swap function swaps with the chosen swap index.
    - Then the score is printed.
